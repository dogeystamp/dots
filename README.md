# dots
My dotfiles.

## Installation

Copy all the folders in here (including hidden ones like .config) to your home directory.
You don't need .git, and you probably don't need my scripts in .local/bin.

After, install the programs that I have dots for. A list is provided in the programs file.

You should install [my dwm](https://github.com/dogeystamp/dwm), [dmenu](https://github.com/dogeystamp/dmenu), [slock](https://github.com/dogeystamp/slock) and [st](https://github.com/dogeystamp/st) builds as well as this for a complete desktop environment.

### Notes

The xinitrc provides changes I like, such as swapping escape and caps lock, which you should remove if you don't need.

Also, by default, the wallpaper is solid black. You can change it by swapping out `.config/wall.png`.
Picom is already configured to blur and fade windows.
If you wish to keep the black wallpaper, disable blur for better performance.

My qutebrowser configuration emphasizes privacy over usability, and you might need to edit it to suit your needs if you want to use it.
