# dots
My dotfiles.

## Installation

Copy all the folders in here (including hidden ones like .config) to your home directory.
You don't need .git, and you probably don't need my scripts in .local/bin (like mon-on or notification-sound.sh).
You also don't need to copy programs and programs-aur, they're there so I can install my programs on new installs.

You should install [my dwm](https://github.com/dogeystamp/dwm), [dmenu](https://github.com/dogeystamp/dmenu), [slock](https://github.com/dogeystamp/slock) and [st](https://github.com/dogeystamp/st) builds as well as this for a complete desktop environment.

### Note

The xinitrc provides changes I like, such as swapping escape and caps lock, which you should remove if you don't need.
