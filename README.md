# dots
My dotfiles.

## Installation

Copy all the folders in here (including hidden ones like .config) to your home directory.
You don't need .git, and you probably don't need my scripts in .local/bin (like mon-on or notification-sound.sh).

You should install [my dwm](https://github.com/dogeystamp/dwm) and [st](https://github.com/dogeystamp/st) builds as well as this.
